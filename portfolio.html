    <h1 style="text-align:center;">My 4.1.4 project was on Simple Genetic Algorithm and the model here is simulating the genetic diversity of a gene pool in a certain population. The effect of gene crossover and mutations are simulated on a population. I would change this model by voiding the fitness graph and having a model that can represent more of how genetics are passed on through generation and not through their ability to survive. It cn be concluded that more genetics crossover results in less diversity and the same way goes both ways.</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/game-image7.PNG" height="250">
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">This is the 3.1.6 project. We were trying to figure out hich region the rover had landed on.
